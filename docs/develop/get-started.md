:class: note

To learn more about about Terra concepts like Luna, validators, and governance, visit the [Terra protocol overview](../learn/protocol.md). 
:::


Follow the steps below to get started with Terrain and build your own dApp!

### 1. Set up Terrain

Terrain is a user-friendly development environment for developing smart contracts. Terrain makes it easy to create smart contract templates, deploy them to the Terra blockchain, and connect them to a frontend app.

Follow the [Terrain setup tutorial](terrain/initial-setup.md) to get started using Terrain. 

### 2. Download LocalTerra and start building

LocalTerra is a mini Terra blockchain that runs locally on your machine. You can use Terrain as a test environment for your projects. 

When you start LocalTerra, youâ€™ll see a single validator writing transactions to your mini blockchain. LocalTerra comes with [10 configurable wallet accounts](localterra/accounts.md) to make testing easier. 

Follow the [Terrain with LocalTerra tutorial](terrain/using-terrain-localterra.md) to start using Terrain and create a simple counter app. 

### 3. Mint an NFT

Now that you are familiar with Terrain and LocalTerra, mint an NFT with Terrain. 

The [NFT minting](terrain/mint-an-nft.md) tutorial walks you through the creation of an NFT minting application, complete with Terrain app scaffolding, smart contract usage, and a front end. You'll even get to mint your own NFT!

## Development Suite

Congrats! You have the basics down! 

Now you can dive into the other tools in the Terra Development Suite:

### Terra<span/>.js

If you are familiar with Javascript, use Terra<span/>.js to create bots, power NFT mints, and for all-purpose back end services. Follow the [Terra.js tutorial](terra-js/getting-started.md) to get started.

### Terra<span/>.py

Use Terra<span/>.py for on-chain analytics, Jupyter Notebooks, data processing, and other mathematical processes. Follow the [Terra.py](https://terra-money.github.io/terra.py/tutorial.html) tutorial to get started.
 
### Wallet Provider and Templates: 

If you have a back end for your app and want a front end to connect to Terra Station, use Wallet provider and Terra Templates. Follow the [Wallet Provider tutorial](wallet-provider/wallet-provider-tutorial.md) to get started. 

### Other Tools

Terra also provides other tools for building:

- [Finder](https://finder.terra.money): Terraâ€™s multi-purpose block explorer. 
- [Faucet](https://faucet.terra.money): Get tokens sent to your testnet address. 
- [`terrad`](terrad/install-terrad.md): the node daemon and command line interface that connects to the Terra network.
