# Install `terrad`

`terrad` is the command-line interface and daemon that connects to Terra and enables you to interact with the Terra blockchain. Terra core is the official Golang reference implementation of the Terra node software.

This guide is for developers who want to install `terrad` and interact with Terra core without running a full node. If you want to run a full node or join a network, visit [](../../../full-node/run-a-full-terra-node/README.md).

### Prerequisites

- [Golang v1.16.1 - go1.17.1 linux/amd64](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Ensure your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables are set up correctly.
- Linux users: install [build-essential](http://linux-command.org/en/build-essential.html).

If you are using a Mac, follow the [`terrad` Mac installation guide](./terrad-mac.md).

## From binary

The easiest way to install `terrad` and Terra core is by downloading a pre-built binary for your operating system. You can find the latest binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/terra-money/core/releases) page. If you have a Mac, follow the [Mac installation instructions](./terrad-mac.md).

## From source

### 1. Get the Terra core source code

Use `git` to retrieve [Terra core](https://github.com/terra-money/core/), and checkout the `main` branch, which contains the latest stable release.

If you are using LocalTerra or running a validator, use the `v0.x.x-oracle` tag. Otherwise, use the `v0.x.x` tag.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terra-money/core
cd core
git checkout [latest version]
```

**Example:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/terra-money/core
cd core
git checkout v0.5.6-oracle
```

### 2. Build Terra core from source

Build Terra core, and install the `terrad` executable to your `GOPATH` environment variable.

```bash
make install
```

### 3. Verify your Terra core installation

Verify that Terra core is installed correctly.

```bash
terrad version --long
```

The following example shows version information when Terra core is installed correctly:

```bash
name: terra
server_name: terrad
client_name: terrad
version: 0.3.0-24-g3684f77
commit: 3684f77faadf6cf200d18e15763316d5d9c5a496
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.13.4 darwin/amd64
```

::: {tip}
If the `terrad: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that the Go binary path is correctly configured by running the following command:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
:::

## Next steps

With `terrad` installed, you can set up a local testing environment using [LocalTerra](../../localterra/README.md).
